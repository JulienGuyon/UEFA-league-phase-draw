# Champions League Draw Scheduler - README

## Project Overview

This repository contains the code r

## Project Structure

The repository contains the implementation of both scheduling approaches:

- **Method 1: Schedule-First Approach**

  - A pre-defined 8-day schedule is created with placeholders for teams. Teams are then assigned to these placeholders while adhering to the constraints, including playing against different pots and maintaining home-away alternation.
  - This method involves solving a linear programming problem using the Gurobi solver to optimize the schedule.

- **Method 2: Matches-First Approach**
  - Matches are drawn sequentially for each team, ensuring that the drawn matches adhere to the constraints before scheduling the match days.
  - The Gurobi solver is used to optimize the match selection, ensuring feasibility and respecting the competition's constraints.
  - This method offers greater flexibility for real-world scheduling scenarios, such as stadium availability or weather conditions.

## Key Features

1. **Constraints Management**:
   - Each team plays exactly 8 matches: 2 against teams from each pot.
   - No team can play against teams from the same country more than twice.
   - Matches are evenly distributed across the eight match days.
   - Teams experience a balance of home and away games, with minimal "breaks" (consecutive home or away games).
2. **Optimization with Gurobi**:

   - The project leverages the Gurobi solver to manage complex scheduling constraints and optimize the draw process.
   - The schedule-first method focuses on balancing the calendar, while the matches-first method allows for more flexible real-world adjustments.

3. **Graph Theory Application**:
   - Graph theory is used to verify the feasibility of match scheduling, ensuring that the draw avoids creating deadlocks and that matches can be scheduled within eight days.
